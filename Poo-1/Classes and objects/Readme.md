# Classes and Objects

Java is a popular, object-oriented programming language Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects,
along with its attributes and methods.

A class is a blueprint to create Objects it can contain Attributes,methods ou behaviors, constructor, nested classes.
We can say a Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

### Object
In Java, an object is created from a class. By creating an object of a class we can have access to everything within the class.

**var person**=new Person("Judas",24,"Av.Eduardo");  

#### The creation  of an object has the following steps:

1. Declaration: The code set in bold are all variable declarations that associate a variable name with an object type.
2. Instantiation: The new keyword is a Java operator that creates the object.
3. Initialization: The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object.

`Person person=new Person("Alfred",23,"Av.25");`

_The code above demonstrate a creation of an object from the Person class:_

# Access Modifiers in Java

In Java, we have 4 types of access modifiers.

- Private
- Default
- protected
- public

## Private Access Modifier

The private access modifier is specified using the keyword private. The methods or attributes declared as private 
are accessible only within the class in which they are declared.

## Default Access Modifier

When no access modifier is specified for a class, method, or data member, it is said to have the default access
modifier by default. This means only classes within the same package can access it.

## Protected Access Modifier

The protected access modifier is specified using the keyword protected. The methods or data members declared as 
protected are accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.

## Public Access Modifier

The public access modifier is specified using the keyword public. Public members are accessible from everywhere in
the program. There is no restriction on the scope of public data members.
